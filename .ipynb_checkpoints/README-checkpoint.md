## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* This analysis was created using a peer-to-peer lending service dataset put into a machine learning model using 'LogisticRegression' to predict if a borrowers loan is High-Risk or Healthy. Loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt the goal was used to get the loan status.

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Accuracy: 99%
    * Precision
        * Healthy Loan 'Class 0': 100%
        * High-Risk Loan 'Class 1': 87%
    * Recall scores:
        * Healthy Loan 'Class 0': 100%
        * High-Risk Loan 'Class 1': 89%

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
